# Faction Wars
FactionWars is a combat oriented roleplay gamemode that pits factions against one another in a battle for territory and resources. Each server offers a set of factions that players can choose to align themselves with. Once aligned with a faction you can work with your teammates to launch wars, capture land, and construct illegal enterprises using our advanced resource system providing electricity, money printers, drugs, weapons, and more.
